# K-means Algorithm
This a k-means algorithm example.
This implementation can only deal with numeric data.
In this implementation, data format is like: number, number, number, ..., class
Of course, you can modify(or, kick away) the 'class' by modifying the func 'ReadCSV'

## how to use:
### Example: main.py -k 2 -f ./data.csv   <br/>#this mean use the k number 2 and CSV file ./data.csv
